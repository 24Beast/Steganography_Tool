# Steganography_Tool
A tool to perform steganography. (i.e. Writing hidden messages, in this case in a picture.) 
The tool will be able to distribute the message among the pixels in different or same colour channels.
The images are saved in png format to prevent loss of data by compression as observed in jpg.
